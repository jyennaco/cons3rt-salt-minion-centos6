			Salt Minion on CentOS6 using EPEL and YUM</h1>
		<div>
This software asset installs the Salt Minion on CentOS6 using EPEL and YUM.  For CONS3RT deployments, this install script looks for either a Scenario role name or a Deployment runtime propety with the name "salt-master".  If salt-master is found, the script automatically installs Salt Minion to point to the salt-master.  Otherwise, this script installs Salt Minion but does not automatically start it.  Note: If salt-master is defined as both a Scenario Role Name and a Deployment Runtime Property, the Scenario Role Name will be used.</div>
		<h2>
			Overview</h2>

			<p>
				Salt is a new approach to infrastructure management. Easy enough to get running in minutes, scalable enough to manage tens of thousands of servers, and fast enough to communicate with them in <em>seconds</em>.&nbsp; Salt delivers a dynamic communication bus for infrastructures that can be used for orchestration, remote execution, configuration management and much more.</p>
